Welcome to the Starknet Docs! 👋

Whether you’re a writing Starknet smart contracts and dApps or contributing to the Starknet ecosystem through tooling, products, or research, the Starknet Docs aims to help you navigate the world of Starknet.

**Where to go next?**

If you’re completely new to Starknet or its programming language, [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/), we suggest first checking out [*What is Starknet?*](https://www.starknet.io/what-is-starknet/) and coming back whenever you’re ready (don’t worry, we’ll still be here). Otherwise:

🚀 Go to *Quickstart* to begin your Starknet journey as a builder or validator (or both!)

🏛️ Go to *Architecture* to deep dive into Starknet’s unique design and features

🛠️ Go to *Tooling* to learn how to harness the power of Starknet’s toolchain

🌍 Go to *Ecosystem* to explore Starknet’s vast third-party landscape

📚 Go to *Resources* to browse through various other useful materials

If you need help at any point, you can click on the chat icon in the lower-right corner of the page to access the Starknet assistant. The assistant is an embedded version of the [Starknet Agent](https://agent.starknet.io/), an AI-powered search engine that uses advanced machine learning algorithms to search and understand the Starknet Docs (and other resources) and provide clear and accurate answers to any queries.

Last but not least, the Starknet Docs takes pride in being a collaborative and open-source effort, and any contributions are more than welcome. If you’re interested, check out the [Starknet Docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/starknet-io/starknet-docs).

We wish you good luck on whatever path you choose, and hope you enjoy embracing the STARK-pilled life! ✨
