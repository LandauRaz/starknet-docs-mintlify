## Introduction

Welcome to the first installment of the *Deploy your first Starknet contract* guide! ðŸ¥‡

As a popular phrase (often attributed to Abraham Lincoln) says, "Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe". The first installment of the series will therefore guide you through setting up your development environment, which will include the three most recommended tools to begin developing on Starknet:

* *Scarb*, a build toolchain and package manager for Cairo and Starknet ecosystems

* *Starknet Foundry*, the go-to framework for building and testing Starknet Smart Contracts

* *Starknet Devnet*, a Rust implementation of a local Starknet node

<Tip>
To review these tools in more detail, as well as all other Starknet developer tools, check out the [Tooling section](/ecosystem/tools/).

## Setting up your environment on MacOS and Linux

### Installing Scarb and Starknet Foundry

On MacOS and Linux, Scarb and Starknet Foundry can be easily installed using the [Starkup installer](https://github.com/software-mansion/starkup) by running:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.starkup.sh | sh

```

and following the onscreen instructions. You can verify that Scarb and Starknet Foundry are installed correctly by running:

```shell
scarb --version
snforge --version && sncast --version

```

If the installation was successful, the result should resemble the following:

```shell
scarb 2.11.4 (c0ef5ec6a 2025-04-09)
cairo: 2.11.4 (https://crates.io/crates/cairo-lang-compiler/2.11.4)
sierra: 1.7.0

snforge 0.42.0
sncast 0.42.0

```

<Note>
Starkup installs Scarb and Starknet Foundry Devnet on MacOS and Linux via the [`asdf` version manager](https://asdf-vm.com/), which allows to easily switch between their different versions, both globally and per project (see full details in the [`asdf` documentation](https://asdf-vm.com/manage/commands.html) or by running `asdf --help`). Alongside Scarb and Starknet Foundry, Starkup uses `asdf` to install additional useful tools, including the [Universal Sierra Compiler](https://github.com/software-mansion/universal-sierra-compiler), [Cairo Profiler](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairo-profiler), [Cairo Coverage](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairo-coverage), and [CairoLS](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairols).If you encounter any issues while using it or have any requests, please help by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/software-mansion/starkup/issues/new).

### Installing Starknet Devnet

[Similar to Scarb and Starknet Foundry](/guides/quickstart/environment-setup#installing-scarb-and-starknet-foundry), it is highly recommended to install Starknet Devnet on MacOS and Linux via the `asdf` version manager. Luckily, if you installed Scarb and Starknet Foundry using the Starkup installer, you should already have `asdf` installed. To install Starknet Devnet using `asdf`:

1. Verify that `asdf` is installed:

   ```shell
   asdf --version
   
   ```

   or install it by following the instructions in the [`asdf` documentation](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html).

2. Install the `asdf` Starknet Devnet plugin:

   ```shell
   asdf plugin add starknet-devnet
   
   ```

3. Install the latest version of Starknet Devnet:

   ```shell
   asdf install starknet-devnet latest
   
   ```

4. Set global version for Starknet Devnet:

   ```shell
   asdf set -u starknet-devnet latest
   
   ```

5. Restart the terminal and verify that Starknet Devnet is installed correctly:

   ```shell
   starknet-devnet --version
   
   ```

If the installation was successful, the result should resemble the following:

```shell
starknet-devnet 0.4.1

```

## Setting up your environment on Windows

Setting up Scarb and Starknet Foundry on Windows requires configuring the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and installing the tools inside a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu.

### Installing WSL and Ubuntu

1. Open PowerShell as administrator and run:

   ```shell
   wsl --install
   
   ```

   This command installs WSL along with the default Ubuntu distribution. If WSL or virtualization is not yet enabled, reboot and re-run the command as needed.

2. Restart your computer when prompted.

3. After reboot, launch Ubuntu from the Start menu. On the first launch, create a UNIX username and password when prompted.

<Note>
If `wsl --install` does not work, enable WSL manually by running:
```shell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart

```
and installing Ubuntu from the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/wslstore).
</Note>

### Installing prerequisites in Ubuntu

1. Open the Ubuntu terminal and run:

   ```shell
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y curl git build-essential
   
   ```

### Installing Homebrew

1. Run the Homebrew install script:

   ```shell
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   
   ```

2. Add Homebrew to your shell environment:

   ```shell
   echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.profile
   source ~/.profile
   
   ```

3. Verify that Homebrew was installed correctly:

   ```shell
   brew --version
   
   ```

### Installing `asdf`

<Note>
Using `asdf` allows you to easily switch between versions of Scarb, Starknet Foundry, and Starknet Devnet globally or per project.
</Note>

1. Install `asdf` using Homebrew:

   ```shell
   brew install asdf
   
   ```

2. Add `asdf` to your shell:

   ```shell
   echo '. "$(brew --prefix asdf)/libexec/asdf.sh"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   
   ```

3. Verify that `asdf` is installed correctly:

   ```shell
   asdf --version
   
   ```

### Installing Scarb, Starknet Foundry, and Starknet Devnet

1. Add the Scarb plugin and install the latest Scarb version:

   ```shell
   asdf plugin add scarb
   asdf install scarb latest
   asdf set -u scarb latest
   
   ```

2. Add the Starknet Foundry plugin and install the latest Starknet Foundry version:

   ```shell
   asdf plugin add starknet-foundry
   asdf install starknet-foundry latest
   asdf set -u starknet-foundry latest
   
   ```

3. Add the Starknet Devnet plugin and install the latest Starknet Devnet version:

   ```shell
   asdf plugin add starknet-devnet
   asdf install starknet-devnet latest
   asdf set -u starknet-devnet latest
   
   ```

4. Restart your terminal and verify that Scarb, Starknet Foundry, and Starknet Devnet were installed correctly:

   ```shell
   scarb --version
   snforge --version && sncast --version
   starknet-devnet --version
   
   ```

   <Tip>
   If `scarb`, `snforge`, or `starknet-devnet` are not recognized, try running `source ~/.bashrc` or restarting your terminal.
