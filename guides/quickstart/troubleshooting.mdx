## Setting up your environment

### Starkli unable to detect shell

Procedure

1. Detect whether your shell is `zsh` or `bash`:

   ```shell
   echo $SHELL
   
   ```

2. Add:

   ```shell
   . /Users/<NAME>/.starkli/env
   
   ```

   to either `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`.

3. Restart the terminal, and run either:

   ```shell
   source ~/.zshrc
   
   ```

   or:

   ```shell
   source ~/.bashrc
   
   ```

## Declaring, deploying, and interacting with HelloStarknet locally

### `scarb build` fails to run version command for Rust

Starting from Scarb version 2.10 and Starknet Foundry version 0.37.0, Rust is longer required for projects with the following line in their `Scarb.toml` file:

```cairo
[tool.scarb]
allow-prebuilt-plugins = ["snforge_std"]
cairoCopied!
```

If not all three conditions are met and Rust is not installed, running `scarb build` (and `scarb test`) will result in a compilation error. To resolve this, either update Scarb, Starknet Foundry, and your `Scarb.toml` file accordingly or [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### `starkli declare` unable to identify compiler version

When using `starkli declare`, Starkli will do its best to identify the compiler version of the declared class. In case it fails, the `--compiler-version` flag can be used to specify the version of the compiler.

Procedure

1. Find the compiler versions supported by Starkli by running:

   ```shell
   starkli declare --help
   
   ```

   and looking for the possible values of the `--compiler-version` flag.

2. Find the current Scarb version in use:

   ```shell
   scarb --version
   
   ```

3. In case a different compiler version is required, switch to a different Scarb version using `asdf`:

   1. Install the desired Scarb version:

      ```shell
      asdf install scarb <VERSION>
      
      ```

   2. Select the desired Scarb version as the local version for the project:

      ```shell
      asdf set scarb <VERSION>
      
      ```

## Deploying and interacting with HelloStarknet on Sepolia

### Fetching a predeployed Sepolia account

Procedure

1. Export the private key from your wallet by:

   * For Ready wallets: navigating to `Settings` → `<YOUR_ACCOUNT>` → `Export Private Key`.

   * For Braavos wallets: navigating to `Settings` → `Privacy and Security` → `Export Private Key`.

2. Create a keystore file by running:

   ```shell
   starkli signer keystore from-key keystore.json
   
   ```

   and entering the private key of your smart wallet, along with a password that will be used to encrypt it.

3. Fetch the account by running:

   ```shell
   starkli account fetch \
       <SMART_WALLET_ADDRESS> \
       --output account.json \
       --network=sepolia
   
   ```
