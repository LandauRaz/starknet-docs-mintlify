## Overview

Welcome to the first installment of the *Become a Starknet validator* guide! âœ…

Following this guide requires Docker, an exported Ethereum URL and three exported Starknet account. This installment of the guide will therefore walk you through [installing Docker](/guides/becoming-a-validator/prerequisite#installing-docker) and exporting [an Ethereum URL](/guides/becoming-a-validator/prerequisite#exporting-an-ethereum-url) and [the required accounts](/guides/becoming-a-validator/prerequisite#exporting-accounts).

## Installing docker

The easiest option to run a Starknet full node is using Docker. To install Docker, simply visit [docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) and choose whatever OS you're using.

## Exporting an Ethereum URL

Running a Starknet full node requires an Ethereum websocket RPC URL. You can get your free Ethereum websocket RPC URL by creating an account with [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), or [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/). Afterwhich, you can export it by running:

```shell
export ETHEREUM_URL=<YOUR_URL>

```

## Exporting accounts

Becoming a Starknet validator requires three accounts deployed on either Sepolia or Mainnet. To follow this guide, these account should be configured as follows:

<Note>
To understand the role of the each account, read more about [validator addresses in the staking protocol](/architecture/staking#addresses).
</Note>

* An account with its address exported using:

  ```shell
  export OPERATIONAL_ADDRESS=<YOUR_OPERATOR_ADDRESS>
  
  ```

* An account with its address exported using:

  ```shell
  export REWARDS_ADDRESS=<YOUR_REWARDEE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
  
  ```

* An `sncast` account named `staker` holding at least [the minimum required amount of STRK tokens](/architecture/staking#protocol) with its address exported using:

  ```shell
  export STAKING_ADDRESS=<YOUR_STAKER_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
  
  ```

  <Tip>
  For deploying and funding an `sncast` account on Sepolia, see [Deploying a new Sepolia account](/guides/quickstart/sepolia#deploying-a-new-sepolia-account).
