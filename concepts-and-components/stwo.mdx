## What is Stwo?

Stwo is a high-performance STARK prover that leverages the Circle STARK protocol to generate zero-knowledge proofs more efficiently than previous generations. It represents a significant advancement in proving technology, offering enhanced performance through optimized field operations, improved backend architecture, and support for GPU acceleration.

The prover is designed to be the next-generation proving system for Starknet, eventually replacing the Stone prover in [SHARP](/concepts-and-components/sharp) for most proving operations.

## Key Features

### Circle STARK Protocol Integration

Stwo leverages the Circle STARK protocol, a collaborative innovation between StarkWare and Polygon Labs. This protocol enables several key advantages:

- **Mersenne Prime Field M31**: Uses the field M31 (2³¹ - 1), which aligns well with modern computer architectures
- **Efficient 32-bit Operations**: Most operations can be performed using standard 32-bit computer words
- **Reduced Computational Overhead**: Smaller field operations lead to faster computations

### Enhanced Performance

Stwo is engineered for exceptional prover performance through several optimizations:

- **Optimized Backend**: Implements STARKs that utilize hash-based SNARKs, offering faster proving compared to elliptic curve-based SNARKs like Groth16 or PLONK
- **Parallel Processing**: Designed to take advantage of modern multi-core processors
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized memory usage patterns for better cache performance

### GPU Acceleration

Through partnerships like the collaboration between Ingonyama and Starknet, Stwo supports GPU acceleration:

- **ICICLE-Stwo**: A GPU-accelerated version that leverages parallel processing capabilities
- **Enhanced Throughput**: Significantly improved proving throughput through GPU parallelization
- **Scalable Performance**: Better performance scaling with hardware improvements

## Technical Architecture

### Field Operations

Stwo operates within the M31 prime field (2³¹ - 1), which provides several technical advantages:

```
M31 = 2^31 - 1 = 2,147,483,647
```

This field choice enables:
- Efficient arithmetic operations using standard 32-bit integers
- Better alignment with modern CPU architectures
- Reduced memory requirements compared to larger fields

### Proof Generation Process

The Stwo prover follows a structured approach to generate STARK proofs:

1. **Trace Generation**: Creates the execution trace from the computation
2. **Polynomial Commitment**: Commits to the trace polynomials using the Circle STARK protocol
3. **Constraint Verification**: Verifies that the trace satisfies all constraints
4. **FRI Protocol**: Applies the Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proof protocol
5. **Proof Packaging**: Packages the proof for verification

### Integration with SHARP

Starting from Starknet version 0.14.0, Stwo is integrated into SHARP's architecture:

- **Primary Prover**: Stwo handles most proof generation tasks
- **Stone Compatibility**: Stone continues to handle recursive tree root proofs to maintain compatibility with existing onchain verifiers
- **Seamless Transition**: The integration maintains backward compatibility while providing performance improvements

## Benefits for Starknet

### Reduced Latency and Costs

The enhanced efficiency of Stwo translates to tangible benefits:

- **Faster Proof Generation**: Reduced time to generate proofs for transactions
- **Lower Transaction Fees**: More efficient proving leads to reduced costs passed to users
- **Improved User Experience**: Faster confirmation times and lower costs

### Enhanced Scalability

Stwo's performance improvements directly impact Starknet's scalability:

- **Higher Throughput**: Ability to handle larger volumes of transactions
- **Better Resource Utilization**: More efficient use of computational resources
- **Future-Proof Architecture**: Designed to scale with hardware improvements

### Developer Benefits

The open-source nature of Stwo provides advantages for developers:

- **Transparency**: Full access to the prover's implementation
- **Customization**: Ability to modify and optimize for specific use cases
- **Innovation**: Community-driven improvements and extensions
